## Note:
**Create a folder named "dataset".** 
**Inside this folder create 2 folders "training_set" and "testing_set".** 
**Now, in both of the above folders create 2 folders named "normal" and "pneumonia".**
**You can paste the images in these folders.**

*I chose to split the dataset in 80-20% for training and testing respectively.*

*You can find dataset by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia "Dataset for Pneumonia Detection").*

### The detailed description of the project and the code is provided with the code in comments.
